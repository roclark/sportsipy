Sportsipy: A free sports API written for python
###############################################

Sportsipy is a free python API that pulls the stats from
www.sports-reference.com and allows them to be easily be used in python-based
applications, especially ones involving data analytics and machine learning.

Sportsipy exposes a plethora of sports information from major sports
leagues in North America, such as the MLB, NBA, College Football and Basketball,
NFL, and NHL. Every sport has its own set of valid API queries ranging from the
list of teams in a league, to the date and time of a game, to the total number
of wins a team has secured during the season, and many, many more metrics that
paint a more detailed picture of how a team has performed during a game or
throughout a season.

Examples
========

The following are a few examples showcasing how easy it can be to collect
an abundance of metrics and information from all of the tracked leagues. The
examples below are only a miniscule subset of the total number of statistics
that can be pulled using sportsipy. Visit the documentation on
`Read The Docs <http://sportsipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for a
complete list of all information exposed by the API.
