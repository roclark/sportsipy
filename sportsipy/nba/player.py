class AbstractPlayer:
    """
    Get player information and stats for all seasons.

    Given a player ID, such as 'hardeja01' for James Harden, capture all
    relevant stats and information like name, nationality, height/weight,
    career three-pointers, last season's offensive rebounds, salary, contract
    amount, and much more.

    By default, the class instance will return the player's career stats, but
    single-season stats can be found by calling the instance with the requested
    season as denoted on basketball-reference.com.

    Parameters
    ----------
    player_id : string
        A player's ID according to basketball-reference.com, such as
        'hardeja01' for James Harden. The player ID can be found by navigating
        to the player's stats page and getting the string between the final
        slash and the '.html' in the URL. In general, the ID is in the format
        'LLLLLFFNN' where 'LLLLL' are the first 5 letters in the player's last
        name, 'FF', are the first 2 letters in the player's first name, and
        'NN' is a number starting at '01' for the first time that player ID has
        been used and increments by 1 for every successive player.
    player_name : string
        A string representing the player's first and last name, such as 'James
        Harden'.
    player_data : string
        A string representation of the player's HTML data from the Boxscore
        page. If the player appears in multiple tables, all of their
        information will appear in one single string concatenated together.
