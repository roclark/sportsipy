class AbstractPlayer:
    """
    Get player information and stats for all seasons.

    Given a player ID, such as 'BreeDr00' for Drew Brees, capture all relevant
    stats and information like name, team, height/weight, career starts, single
    season pasing yards, sacks, and much more.

    By default, the class instance will return the player's career stats, but
    single-season stats can be found by calling the instance with the requested
    season as denoted on pro-football-reference.com.

    Parameters
    ----------
    player_id : string
        A player's ID according to pro-football-reference.com, such as
        'BreeDr00' for Drew Brees. The player ID can be found by navigating to
        the player's stats page and getting the string between the final slash
        and the '.htm' in the URL. In general, the ID is in the format
        'LlllFfNN' where 'Llll' are the first 4 letters in the player's last
        name with the first letter capitalized, 'Ff' are the first 2 letters in
        the player's first name where the first letter is capitalized, and 'NN'
        is a number starting at '00' for the first time that player ID has been
        used and increments by 1 for every successive player.
    player_name : string
        A string representing the player's first and last name, such as 'Drew
        Brees'.
    player_data : string
        A string representation of the player's HTML data from the Boxscore
        page. If the player appears in multiple tables, all of their
        information will appear in one single string concatenated together.
