class BoxscorePlayer(AbstractPlayer):
    """
    Get player stats for an individual game.

    Given a player ID, such as 'carsen-edwards-1' for Carsen Edwards, their
    full name, and all associated stats from the Boxscore page in HTML format,
    parse the HTML and extract only the relevant stats for the specified player
    and assign them to readable properties.

    This class inherits the ``AbstractPlayer`` class. As a result, all
    properties associated with ``AbstractPlayer`` can also be read directly
    from this class.

    As this class is instantiated from within the Boxscore class, it should not
    be called directly and should instead be queried using the appropriate
    players properties from the Boxscore class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    player_id : string
        A player's ID accorsing to sports-reference.com, such as
        'carsen-edwards-1' for Carsen Edwards. The player ID can be found by
        navigating to the player's stats page and getting the string between
        the final slash and the '.html' in the URL. In general, the ID is in
        the format 'first-last-N' where 'first' is the player's first name in
        lowercase, 'last' is the player's last name in lowercase, and 'N' is a
        number starting at '1' for the first time that player ID has been used
        and increments by 1 for every successive player.
    player_name : string
        A string representing the player's first and last name, such as 'Carsen
        Edwards'.
    player_data : string
        A string representation of the player's HTML data from the Boxscore
        page. If the player appears in multiple tables, all of their
        information will appear in one single string concatenated together.
